Building Human Detection System to count the people passing a particular 
region of space is an important and challenging field of research in visual 
surveillance. Detection through Image/Video/Webcam is a Machine Learning 
project on computer vision which seeks to understand and automate tasks that 
the human visual system can do. Histogram of Oriented Gradient(HOG) is one of 
the eminent algorithms for human shape detection. HOG features are extracted 
from all location of a dense grid on an image region and use linear Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the combined features. The HOG and SVM 
algorithm concentrate on the contrast of silhouette contours against 
the background. Human Detection and Counting System helps in Congestion 
analysis, finding the most used bus routes, most visited places, provides 
continuous surveillance and also helpful in pandemic situation to monitor the 
people count.
